 	Abstract
 </h2>
 <p>
	The centenary of the 1916 Easter Rising was celebrated in 2016, the centrepiece of a decade-long programme of national commemoration in the Republic of Ireland. Marked by digitality and widely declared a success for public engagement with history, the centenary also represented a turning point in feminist re-appraisal of the Irish revolution, one that has been reflected in wider societal shifts concerning the position and freedoms of Irish women today. Drawing upon the primary author's doctoral research, which investigated the nature of feminist commemoration through Twitter in 2016, this article demonstrates the methods and collaboration involved in collecting 'historical' tweets from the 1916 centenary via the Twitter Premium API as well as the ethical considerations and methodological challenges of such research.
